# Student, Instructor, Classroom
* **Purpose** - to demonstrate the use of [Java interfaces](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java/interfaces.html)


# Part 1.1 - Create `Person` Class
* Create a `Person` class.
	* `Person` constructor should have a parameter of type `String` which sets the `name` instance-variable to the respective value.
	* `Person` should have a `getName()` method which returns the `Person` object's `name` variable.
	* `Person` should have a `setName()` method which sets the `Person` object's `name` variable.

-
# Part 1.0 - Test `Person`
* Create a `TestPerson` class.
	* Create a `testSetName` method which ensures that a `Person` object's `name` variable is being set by invoking the `.setName` method.
	* Create a `testConstructor` method which ensures that a `Person` object's `name` variable is being set by invoking the `Person` constructor.

-
# Part 2.0 - Create `Learner` Interface
* Create a `Learner` interface.
	* `Learner` should declare one method signature:
		* Method name: `learn`
		* Method parameters: `double numberOfHours`
		* Method return-type: `void`

-
# Part 3.1 - Create `Student` Class
* Create a `Student` class such that:
	* `Student` is a subclass of `Person`
	* `Student` implements the `Learner` interface
	* `Student` should have an instance variable `totalStudyTime` of type `double`
	* `Student` should have a concrete implementation of the `learn` method which increments the `totalStudyTime` variable by the specified `numberOfHours` argument.
	* `Student` should have a `getTotalStudyTime()` method which returns the `totalStudyTime` instance variable.


-
# Part 3.0 - Test `Student`
* Create a `TestStudent` class.
	* Create a `testImplementation` method that asserts that a `Student` is an `instanceof` a `Learner`.
	* Create a `testInheritance` method that asserts that a `Student` is an `instanceof` a `Person`.
	* Create a `testLearn` method that ensures a `Student`'s `totalStudyTime` instance variable is incremented by the specified `numberOfHours` by invoking the `.learn` method.

-
# Part 4.0 - Create `Teacher` Interface
* Create a `Teacher` interface.
	* `Teacher` should declare a `teach` method signature:
		* Method name: `teach`
		* Method parameters:
			* `Student student`
			* `double numberOfHours`GO SIT NEXT TO 
		* Method return-type: `void` 

	* `Teacher` should declare a `lecture` method signature:
		* Method name: `lecture`
		* Method parameters:
			* `Student[] student`
			* `double numberOfHours`
		* Method return-type: `void`

		
-
# Part 5.1 - Create `Instructor` Class
* Create an `Instructor` class such that:
	* `Instructor` is a subclass of `Person`
	* `Instructor` implements the `Teacher` interface
	* `Instructor` should have a concrete implementation of the `teach` method which invokes the `learn` method on the specified `Student` object.
	* `Instructor` should have a concrete implementation of the `lecture` method which invokes the `learn` method on each of the elements in the specified array of `Student` objects.
		* `numberOfHours` should be evenly split amongst the students.
			* `double numberOfHoursPerStudent = numberOfHours / students.length;`

-
# Part 5.0 - Test `Instructor`
* Create a `TestInstructor` class.
	* Create a `testImplementation` method that asserts that an `Instructor` is an `instanceof` a `Teacher`.
	* Create a `testInheritance` method that asserts that a `Instructor` is an `instanceof` a `Person`.
	* Create a `testTeach` method that ensures when an `Instructor` invokes the `.teach` method, a respective student's `totalStudyTime` instance variable is incremented.
	* Create a `testLecture` method that ensures when an `Instructor` invokes the `.teach` method, a respective student's `totalStudyTime` instance variable is incremented by the specified `numberOfHours`.

	
-
# Part 6.1 - Create `ZipCodeWilmington` Class
* Create a `ZipCodeWilmington` class.
	* _Statically_ instantiate a `private` `ArrayList` of `Instructor` objects named `instructorList`.
	* Create a `public static` method named `hire` which adds an `Instructor` to the `instructorList` and returns `void`.
	* Create a `public static` method named `getInstructors` which returns the `instructorList`.
	* Create a `public static` method named `fireStaff` which clears our `instructorList`.
	* Copy and paste this `static initialization block` immediately below your `instructorList` declaration.

```java
static { // static initializer
	String[] instructorNames = { "Leon", "Tariq", "Froilan", "David", "Zach", "Iyasu" };
	for (String instructorName : instructorNames) {
		Instructor instructor = new Instructor(instructorName);
		hire(instructor);
	}
}
```


-
# Part 6.0 - Test `ZipCodeWilmington`
* Create a `TestZipCodeWilmington` class.
	* Create a method named `setup` which is annotated with `@Before`, takes has no parameters, and returns `void`.
		* Ensure this method invokes the `.fireStaff` method on `ZipCodeWilmington`
	
	* Create a `testFireStaff` method which ensures that our `instructorList` in our `ZipCodeWilmington` class `isEmpty` upon invokation.
	* Create a `testHireStaff` method which ensures that our `instructorList` is populated with respective `Instructor` objects.

-
# Part 7.1 - Create `TechConnect` Class
* Create a `TechConnect` class.
	* _Statically_ instantiate a `private` `ArrayList` of `Student` objects named `studentList`.
	* Create a `public static` method named `recruitStudent` which adds a `Student` to the `studentList` and returns `void`.
	* Create a `public static` method named `getStudents` which returns the `studentList`.
	* Create a `public static` method named `removeStudents` which clears our `studentList`.
	* Copy and paste this `static initialization block` immediately below your `studentList` declaration.

```java
static { // static initializer
	String[] studentNames = { "Karen", "Liel", "Quinn", "Destiny", "Blesson", "Danielle B.", "Andre", "Jeff",
			"Carlo", "Julia D.", "Natalie", "Julia E.", "Shylee", "Genevieve", "Margo", "Whitney", "Rachel",
			"Bridget", "Seung", "Jessica", "Harry", "Kesler", "Darin", "Jade", "Dominika", "Nashae", "Brianna",
			"Laurent", "Rina", "Emily", "Elisha", "Caitlin", "Kierra", "Dana", "Alyssa", "Humaira", "Prajwal",
			"Cristine",  "Brendan" };
	for (String studentName : studentNames) {
		Student student = new Student(studentName);
		studentList.add(student);
	}
}
```
	

-
# Part 7.0 - Test `TechConnect`
* Create a `TestTechConnect` class.
	* Create a method named `setup` which is annotated with `@Before`, takes has no parameters, and returns `void`.
		* Ensure this method invokes the `.removeStudents` method on `TechConnect`
	
	* Create a `testRemoveStudents` method which ensures that our `studentList` in our `TechConnect` class `isEmpty` upon invokation.
	* Create a `testRecruitStudent` method which ensures that our `studentList` is populated with respective `Student` objects.

-
# Part 8.1 - Create `ClassRoom` Class
* Create a `ClassRoom` class.
	* Create a method named `getRoster` which returns a `HashMapping` of `String` to `Person` objects such that our `ZipCodeWilmington` instructors and `TechConnect` students' names map to their respective `Person` object.
	* Getting started hint below!
		* instantiate an `ArrayList` of `Student` objects named `students` by invoking the `getStudents` method on the `TechConnect` class.
		* instantiate an `ArrayList` of `Instructor` objects named `instructors` by invoking the `getInstructor` method on the `ZipCodeWilmington` class.

-
# Part 8.0 - Test `ClassRoom`
* Create a `TestClassRoom` class.
	* Assert that the `HashMapping` returned by `getRoster`, returns a `valueSet` containing each of the `Person` objects in `ZipCodeWilmington`'s `instructorList` and `TechConnect`'s `studentList`.
